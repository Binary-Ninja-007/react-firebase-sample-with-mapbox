# React sample application using Firebase with Mapbox

This project was made with purpose to serve as a pratical example using firebase, redux and mapbox to handle markers on a map. You can put a marker on map using your google account, for any other user running this app will be updated with your marker. This is also a study case for lib `react-redux-firebase` that make firebase very easy to use for simple realtime applications.

## Libs
 - [ReactMapboxGl](https://github.com/alex3165/react-mapbox-gl)
 - [React Redux Firebase](http://react-redux-firebase.com/)
 - [Redux](http://redux.js.org/)
 - [Moment](https://momentjs.com/)
 - [Material UI](https://material-ui-1dab0.firebaseapp.com)
> I think this UI framework is fantastic and decided use the alpha version to test, some features like CSSJS are amazing.

## What it does?
This sample must provide the follow functionalities:
 - Google auth login
 - See reltime markers on the map
 - Create yout own marker with your google avatar

## Possible implementations
 - Facebook login
 - User profile edit
 - Edit markers
 - Delete a marker
 - Any ideas?
